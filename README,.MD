VISUALISATION DONE ON IRIS DATASET

IRIS DATASET:
The Iris dataset is a classic and widely used dataset in data science and machine learning, introduced by Ronald A. Fisher in 1936. 
It consists of 150 samples, each representing an iris flower with four numerical features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width (all in centimeters),
along with a categorical label for the species—Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica. Each species is equally represented with 50 samples, making the dataset balanced and ideal 
for classification tasks. Due to its simplicity, low dimensionality, and clean structure, the Iris dataset is commonly used for exploring data visualization techniques, testing \
classification algorithms, and teaching concepts in supervised and unsupervised learning. Features like petal length and width are particularly 
effective in distinguishing between species, with Setosa being clearly separable from the others, while Versicolor and Virginica show some overlap.
